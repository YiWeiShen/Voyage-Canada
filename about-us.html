                        It all began in the winter of 2019. That year, our founders met in the mountains of British Columbia when it was the perfect time for snow skiing. Yes, the founders were met on the snow. After skiing, Aswin found he took Rejo's helmet for mistake when he got back home. Aswin tried to contact Rejo so that he could return the wrong helmet and get his own back. It turned out Rejo also took David's helmet for mistake. Long story short, the helmet David took home was Aswin's. That is the beginning of the friendship. We share the similarity of travellers, so in the end we decided to found this company.
